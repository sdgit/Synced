For users running from source simply run "python Sickbeard.py"
3) Bookmark Synced

The first time you start Synced it will open its home page in your browser. Bookmark this page so you can return to it later. Note: closing your browser window does not close Synced! Just because you're not looking at it doesn't mean it's not running.
